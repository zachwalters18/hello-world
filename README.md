# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow for CSC430.
My name is Zachary Walters and I am originally from Marion, IL. A little bit about is that I like to drum, work out, and play games. I also really enjoy watching movies and my favorite one as of now is Parasite. I'm starting to get into cooking and hope that I can really enhance that skill as I really like eating good food. In the future, I am hoping to get into travelling and exploring different countries including Japan, Italy, and Switzerland.
